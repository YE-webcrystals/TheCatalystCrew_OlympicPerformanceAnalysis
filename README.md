# Objective of the Project 📚:
**1. Statistical Representation** : Explores the statistics means related to Olympic history 🥇🥈🥉.

**2. Selected Details** : Country Wise statistics based on number of medals won by each country and later distrivuting among the three categories of Bronze, Silver and Gold.

**3. Gaphical representation** : There are three graphs used in the process related to gold medals won over time, top 10 countries by gold mdeals and top 10 sports by medal count.

**4. Checking orders/ Sorting out** : You can filter out different players in accordance to most wins or most medals, and same applies ofr countries.

# Tools And Libraries Used 🛠️ : 

This project leverages the following tools and libraries to run:

1. Python : The primary programming language for data analysis and visualization. 🐍
2. Pandas : A powerful data manipulation and analysis library. 🐼
3. Seaborn : A data visualization library built on Matplotlib. 📊
4. Matplotlib : A popular data plotting library for creating interactive visualizations. 📈
5. Streamlit : Ability to turn Python scripts into user-friendly web apps without needing extensive web development skills.

# Data Sources: 

You can access the two datasets from the following link;

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/data.

This includes the two files named, athlete_events.csv and noc_regions.csv.

# Execution Steps 🛠: 

To run this project in VS CODE;

1. Once you have written the code and saved it in the file. Make sure you have installed all the lubraries in it.

2. Then make sure to run the terminal in the correct directory.

3. Make sure the datasets are well opened. Open the terminal. 

4.  To run the project type : streamlit run filename.py [filename is your currrent file name ] in this case 1.py **[streamlit run 1.py]**

5. It will open a webpage stating LOCAL URL AND NETWORK URL in the terminal.
